Question 1:
1. Explain the difference between primitive types and object references in JavaScript.

Primitive types are just types for variables can be defined in javascript or any language, where just the value of this variable will be assigned to another variable without keep a reference to first vairable.
Object Reference: when the object assigned to another, the other object will keep a reference to the first object, where the changing in the first object will affect the other also.

2.Write a code snippet demonstrating how changing the value of a property in an object affects all references to that object.

let name = "Fadi";
let backName = name;
backName = "Mohammad";

console.log(name);    ### Output: "Fadi"
console.log(backName);  #### Output: "Mohammad"

let arr = [1, 3, 4];
let backArr = arr;
backArr[1] = 77;
console.log(backArr);  ## Output: (3) [1, 77,4]
console.log(arr);  ## Output: (3) [1, 77,4]
